Here's the lab, please tell me if I got the mark since this lab
was extensively harder and longer than the previous ones. It was also
difficult because I had to do the assignment too. If you feel
there is anything missing, please let me know since technically
I still have the 24th to hand it in and I don't wish to lose the mark.


RADIX.PY CONTAINS 3,4 AND 5!!!!

Thanks.

Bob (WeiZhao) Kong.
